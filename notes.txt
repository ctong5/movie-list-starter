## WEBPACK
- runs all sources, styles, dependencies all at once
- npm install
- npm install -g webpack

## BABEL
- babel can be configured in many ways. need a babel-preset for react

## TROUBLESHOOTING
* Webpack will contain everything imported/exported and its scope
    * if we only write import React in index.js, it does NOT have global scope
  * CHECK IF SRC=REACT IS IMPORTED GLOBALLY IN INDEX.HTML

* Blank screen
- Check console

* React is not defined:
- React is not imported on where the error is reported to be happening. If React is not imported, you will see what Babel is transpiling

* Do we have access to an imported file? 
- console.log file name!

* I want to console.log in my stateless expression
- ES6 syntax parens to brackets because we need a return statement. Parens is just a single line return 

* this.props vs. props
- when our component is stateless, it takes an input, outputs it, and works. 
but it has no methods that sit on it and no continued access after it's been created.
- when referencing outside of constructur function, we need to say this.props. 
because we're refering to an instance of props that's been instantiated. In a class 
(click handler, etc that is referencing the props), props need to be
available after being instantiated, need to keep refering back to class constructor

* where would you have stateful component? what components need access to it?
