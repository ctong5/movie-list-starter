## WEBPACK
- runs all sources, styles, dependencies all at once
- npm install
- npm install -g webpack

## BABEL
- babel can be configured in many ways. need a babel-preset for react

## TROUBLESHOOTING
* Webpack will contain everything imported/exported and its scope
    * if we only write import React in index.js, it does NOT have global scope
  * CHECK IF SRC=REACT IS IMPORTED GLOBALLY IN INDEX.HTML

* Blank screen
- Check console

* React is not defined:
- React is not imported on where the error is reported to be happening. If React is not imported, you will see what Babel is transpiling

* Do we have access to an imported file? 
- console.log file name!

* I want to console.log in my stateless expression
- ES6 syntax parens to brackets because we need a return statement. Parens is just a single line return 

* this.props vs. props
- when our component is stateless, it takes an input, outputs it, and works. 
but it has no methods that sit on it and no continued access after it's been created.
- when referencing outside of constructur function, we need to say this.props. 
because we're refering to an instance of props that's been instantiated. In a class 
(click handler, etc that is referencing the props), props need to be
available after being instantiated, need to keep refering back to class constructor

* where would you have stateful component? what components need access to it?

* where would I want to keep state?
- map out the component structure and what components need to use that state (Search and Movie List). 
Place state in common ancestor (App).

* module build failed, syntax error
- check 

* form onSubmit...event.target.value ...the form's value is undefined. 

* onChange is change to the value (value of the tag)
*CANT submit an input, can only submit a form. onSubmit is ONLY in a form.

<input name=testState >
<input name=testState2 >
<input name=testState3 >

this.setState({
  event.target.name >> creates name state on the fly
  [event.target.name] ---> creates this.state.testState2 on the fly
})

## LEARNINGS
- any event handler has e as default first argument

QUESTIONS
- form submit should be able to console log something right? Want to console log that the button works. 
## FILE STRUCTURE
|-- dist
|-- node_modules
|-- src
    |-- components
        |-- MovieList.jsx
        |-- 
    |-- data
        |-- exampleMovieListData
    |-- index.js
|-- package.json


* Create src/components
* Create src/data
