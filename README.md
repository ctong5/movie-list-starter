# Movie List Starter Repo
This repo will provide a starting point for building Movie List, an educational prompt to practice building full-stack React Applications. The starter repo comes with full webpack setup, with the exception of a single transpilation error, embedded to allow students to practice.

## Setup
- Clone the repo to your desired directory
- Setup desired NPM scripts (i.e., what should the package.json file look like in the "scripts" section, how do we want to start our application?)
- Run webpack and review the transpiled output--does the React code look as you expect?
- Debug your transpilation!
- If you are stuck, check out the solution branch (after thinking through the debugging process and discussing with a peer).
